Dear [Manager Name],

I want to apply for annual vacation starting from [start date] till [end date] and want to ask for your approval. These dates are important to me because they coincide with [the big festival in hometown]. I have checked with my colleagues and there is no conflict in the schedules, coverage will be maintained during my absence.

Looking forward to your approval for my annual leave application.

Best Regards
