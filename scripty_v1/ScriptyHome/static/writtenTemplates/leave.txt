Dear [Manager Name],<br>

I want to apply for annual vacation starting from [start date] till [end date] and want to ask for your approval. These dates are important to me because they coincide with [the big festival in hometown]. I have checked with my colleagues and there is no conflict in the schedules, coverage will be maintained during my absence.<br>

Looking forward to your approval for my annual leave application.<br>

Best Regards
