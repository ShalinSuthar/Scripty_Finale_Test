Dear sir<br>
I am writing today to complain of the poor service I received from your company on June 12, 2020. I was visited by a representative of That Awful Company, Mr. Madman, at my home on that day.<br>
I trust this is not the way That Awful Company wishes to conduct business with valued customers have been with you since the company was founded and have never encountered such treatment before.<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
XYZ
